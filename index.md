I'm currently getting more familar with `git`, here are some commands I'm familiar with:
```
git clone
git add
git commit -m "commmit message"
git status
git push origin "branch"
```
... and so on.

## Current interests/hobbies
Due to my iterest in game development I have experience with both [unity](https://unity.com/) and [blender](https://www.blender.org/).

So far I have made 3 avatars in blender
1. A pengiun
2. A person
3. A goat

Usually the model making process goes like this:

- [ ] Find concept art
- [ ] Shape the front and side to ressemble the reference
- [ ] Use sculpt mode to round out the edges and made it look okay in 3d
- [ ] Redo the topology
- [ ] Mark seams for texturing
- [ ] Find or create a texture for the model
- [ ] Add bones and weight paint them
- [ ] Export the model
